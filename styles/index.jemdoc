== Biography

Hang Zhang is currently a second year M.Phil student in Department of Computer Science \& Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. 
He is supervised by Prof. [http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~fyyoung/ Evangeline F. Y. Young] and co-supervised by Prof. [http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~byu/ Bei Yu]. 
Before that, he received the B. Eng degree from [http://www.scu.edu.cn/en/ Sichuan University] in 2015, under the supervision of Prof. [http://www.scu.edu.cn/eie/faculty/webinfo/2010/10/1286178494662243.htm Xiaohai He].

He started his research in VLSI CAD in August 2015. His main research interests include but are not limited to machine learning and lithography hotspot detection. 
He is also interested in machine learning theories and its applications in the related areas, such as data mining, pattern recognition and computer vision. 
# He is also interested in other advanced topics in machine learning, such as online learning and optimization.
